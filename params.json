It is possible to activate one [here](https://developer.echonest.com/account/register \"Create an Echo Nest account\").\r\n  - *output_folder*: the name of the folder where the STL files will be exported\r\n  - *height_Y*: the height of the final model along the Y axis (i.e. its depth)\r\n  - *height_Z*: the height of the final model along the Z axis (i.e. its \"vertical\" height)\r\n  - *ma_window*: number of samples used by the moving average to process the waveform (for local files only)\r\n  - *depth_factor*: number of times a single STFT row is repeated on the Y axis (for local files, STFT mode only)\r\n  - *min_absolute_value*: the minimum height on the Y axis of the waveform\r\n  - *n_waveform_bars*: number of continous bars that will be merged. By varying this parameter it is possible to create an effect similar to the [Soundcloud waveform with \"squared\" bars](https://developers.soundcloud.com/assets/posts/waveform_rendering_blurred-e5dfdb680b95ea92d89611c513691d94.png)\r\n  - *scale*: scales the height (surface)  of the resulting STL mesh. Tune to match needs (see [here](https://github.com/thearn/stl_tools))\r\n  - *mask_val*: any element of the inputted array that is less than this value will not be included in the mesh (see [here](https://github.com/thearn/stl_tools))\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n  - Implement \"more three-dimensional\" shapes, such as circles/squares etc\r\n  - \"Jewelry\" option that will include holes in the 3D model\r\n  - Implement the option of including text (e.g. name of the track, text of the voice recording, etc) on the 3D model\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nIn case of a \"ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation maximum which has no identity\", try reducing the mask_val in the settings.",
